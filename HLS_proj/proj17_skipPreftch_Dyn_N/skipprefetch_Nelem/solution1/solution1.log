@I [HLS-10] Checking synthesizability ...
@W [SYNCHK-77] The top function 'skipprefetch_Nelem' (skipprefetch_Nelem.cpp:17) has no outputs. Possible cause(s) are: (1) Output parameters are passed by value; (2) intended outputs (parameters or global variables) are never written; (3) there are infinite loops.
@I [SYNCHK-10] 0 error(s), 1 warning(s).

@I [SCHED-61] Pipelining result: Target II: 1, Final II: 9, Depth: 17.
@W [SCHED-21] Estimated clock period (13.9ns) exceeds the target (target clock period: 10ns, clock uncertainty: 1.25ns, effective delay budget: 8.75ns).
@W [SCHED-21] The critical path consists of the following:
	'load' operation ('buff_load', skipprefetch_Nelem.cpp:46) on array 'buff', skipprefetch_Nelem.cpp:27 (2.71 ns)
	'add' operation ('a2_sum', skipprefetch_Nelem.cpp:46) (2.44 ns)
